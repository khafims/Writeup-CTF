# CTF Writeups

This repository contains my personal writeups from various Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.
The main purpose of this repository is to document my learning process in cybersecurity,
especially in understanding vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and security concepts.

I started participating in CTF competitions as a beginner and use this repository as a
knowledge base to track progress, mistakes, and lessons learned from each challenge.
Some writeups are written in English and Indonesian.

## Focus Areas
Writeups in this repository cover the following categories:

- Cryptography
- Reverse Engineering
- Binary Exploitation (Pwn)

Difficulty ranges from **beginner to intermediate**, depending on the challenge.
