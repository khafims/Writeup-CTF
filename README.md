# CTF Writeups

This repository contains my personal writeups from various Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.
The main purpose of this repository is to document my learning process in cybersecurity,
especially in understanding vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and security concepts.

I started participating in CTF competitions as a beginner and use this repository as a
knowledge base to track progress, mistakes, and lessons learned from each challenge.
Some writeups are written in English and Indonesian.

## Background
I began learning CTF to improve my technical understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals.
Rather than focusing only on rankings or results, this repository emphasizes:
- How challenges are approached
- Why a solution works
- What can be learned from each problem

This repository is actively updated as I continue learning and participating in CTFs.

## Focus Areas
Writeups in this repository cover the following categories:

- Web Exploitation
- Cryptography
- Reverse Engineering
- Binary Exploitation (Pwn)
- Digital Forensics
- Miscellaneous

Difficulty ranges from **beginner to intermediate**, depending on the challenge.
